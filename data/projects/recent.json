I also supported sprint planning, helped define the level of effort for various tasks, and led all front-end development within Drupal using Acquia's Site Studio.</p><p>Leveraging Site Studio, I built a flexible, custom authoring experience with tools that gave content creators control over layout, spacing, animations, color themes, component variations, and more â€” all with built-in authoring guidance to streamline the workflow.</p><p>The final website features rich animations, including both custom-scripted transitions and Lottie-based animations for added interactivity and performance.</p>",

In this project, I played a key role in bridging client needs with both design and development execution. As the lead front-end Drupal developer, I also contributed to UX and UI decisions as the site moved through later stages of development.</p> <p>Notable features include a custom homepage hero banner supporting flexible layouts, media types, and text animations. At the client's request, I developed a custom bookmarking feature that allows users to add or remove content items through a right-hand slide-out sidebar. This functionality was built using React and integrated into a fully custom JavaScript sidebar menu component.</p>",
